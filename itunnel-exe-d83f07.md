The version 1.3 of this software aims to help users easily enter and exit recovery mode without the need for complex procedures, but like many executable files, it raises concerns regarding its safety. While iTunnel.exe is not inherently a virus or malware, users must be cautious, as it can sometimes be flagged by antivirus programs due to being an unfamiliar application or if it has been tampered with.
